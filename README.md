# Project 2

KidConnect is an app that is created for parents and guardians of children with Developmental Delays and/or Autism. It's a place where users can keep track of events such as doctor appointments or playdates and keep notes on appointments with doctors and thearpists. Users are able to have one place to go to keep track of all things related to the progress of their child.
